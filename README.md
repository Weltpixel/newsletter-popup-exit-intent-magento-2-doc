<h1>ABOUT MAGENTO POPUP FOR NEWSLETTER AND EXIT INTENT.</h1>
<p>
Build your email list, bigger, faster than ever before. You can create beautiful pop ups in minutes & start converting your website visitors into subscribers, social followers & customers. The extension comes with 4 conversion rate optimized responsive designs.
  </p>
  <p>
This extension provides the merchants the possibility to collect customer email addresses in a pop-up box or a signup floating bar at the bottom of the screen, in <strong>an intelligent conversion oriented way</strong>. It is fully responsive and looks good on all mobile devices. You have full control over newsletter popup content, so you can easily add promotions, discounts or any type of message that will make your audience join your mailing list. By using a mailing list, you can remain in contact with your customers, and constantly engage with them, providing useful information about your products, services and occasional promotions. Mailing lists are a powerful sales channel that every merchant should use to increase conversions.
  </p>
  <h1>Why does this extension increase signups?</h1>
  <p>
  Well, because it was built in a conversion oriented way. We added a few features that we tested and measured, in order to increase the newsletter signup rate. You can set it up to trigger based on all sort of smart configurations like the ones described below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Newsletter will trigger after a specific number of seconds.</strong> It is known that if you use a time delay before triggering the newsletter signup, the customer signup conversion rate increases significantly. The good news is that this extension has such a setting available, allowing you to delay the popup trigger.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Newsletter will trigger only on specific pages.</strong> With this extension you can choose on what pages the newsletter popup will trigger. We made sure to avoid newsletter trigger on pages like cart or checkout, and left merchants with the possibility of choosing to trigger on any of the remaining store pages or only on homepage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Newsletter will trigger after a specific number of pages.</strong> Each visitor has it's own way of surfing your site. You don't want to rush to early and ask for the email signup as the customer didn't had the chance to get familiar with your brand yet. So, for this purpose we added the possibility to display the email popup after a specific number of seconds as the signup conversion is much higher once your customers get familiar with your brand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Newsletter can trigger only on desktop, mobile or both</strong>, but if you set it up to trigger also on mobile, the design is already responsive. You can even use your own static block if you want as we made sure to include this possibility in order to allow merchants complete flexibility.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Popup Lifetime</strong> is a smart one. You don't want to hassle your customers so we have an option for popup lifetime. Once the customer closes the popup it will not show up for a while. The good news is that with this extension you can configure the lifetime period of the popup in order to match your brand identity and marketing strategy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Newsletter will trigger on "Exit Intent".</strong> We have integrated a smart functionality that detects when the visitor is going to leave your store. That is a perfect moment to ask for staying in touch. We made sure you can use a different popup for for the exit intent newsletter popup as the message you show might be different than the one you may show to the user while browsing your store.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Trigger newsletter with custom button.</strong> In some cases you may want to show a button on your website, and when clicked to trigger the newsletter popup. You have it out of the box in this extension, just set it up with the right message and let the customers choose by themselves when they want to signup.
</p>

<p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-newsletter/Timer-and-Lifetime.png"></p>
<p>
Timing is key, don’t just stick to show the popup to all your customers as soon as they land on the page. Allow them to breath a bit, to engage with your website, to get more familiar.
  </p>
  <p>
Using <strong>time delay triggers</strong> you can control the timing of your offers and engage with your customers only after they get more comfortable with your website. You can select how many pages they should interact with and how much time they should spend before you engage with them.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>Popup lifetime</strong> allows you to provide a better signup experience to your visitors, if they close the newsletter popup it will not show up again until the lifetimes expires. This will help to avoid customer hassle and only display the signup form at the best appropriate moment.
</p>
<h2>Page Level Display and visited pages trigger.</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-newsletter/After-Visited-pages.png"></p>
<p>
Target where you would like to display the popup message. You now have the option to select to display the popup on the Homepage only or on All pages. Fine tune your offers to make them more relevant.
</p>
<p>
Also, you can choose to let your customers engage with your website, to get more familiar and only display the newsletter popup after a specific number of visited pages - vizited pages trigger. We all know that the first instinct when you see a popup on the landing page the immediate instinct is to close it and engage with the content. This kind of option showed great results in subscription conversion compared with instant popup behaviour.
</p>
<h2>Display on Mobile, Desktop or Both.</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-newsletter/On-Mobile.png"></p>
<p>
Mobile friendliness is vital these days. Make sure that you offer the best mobile friendly experience. People on the go need the information fast and easily accessible. Our popup is not just fully responsive but also allows for you to <strong>choose to display on mobile devices or not</strong>. Make sure you A/B test what works best for you and your customers.

<h2 style="font-weight: 600;">HOW TO CONFIGURE THE MULTISTEP EXPERIENCE</h2>
  <p>
    The multistep experience is essential when testing conversion rate optimization.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <p>
    <li>
        The <strong>first step</strong> is often used to enhance the customer’s need for a discount or offer without asking anything at this point in return.
    </p>
<p>
This step has a very simple and direct message. The design can be kept simple and clean.
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>
The <strong>second step</strong> focuses on gathering the data that you need. This step will contain the newsletter subscription form along with GDPR compliance message.
</li>
</p>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-newsletter/a4.png"></p>
<ul>
    <p>
    <li>
       To enable the multistep experience, simply select the <strong>Two Steps</strong> option under <strong>Signup Steps</strong>.
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>
You will now have options to configure the label for each button or if you would like it enabled or disabled.
</li>
</p>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-newsletter/a5.png"></p>
 <p>
The content is easily customizable, for each step, simply go to: Content -> Blocks and search for Newsletter
</p>
<p>
Depending on your design you will have two blocks for each step. For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>WeltPixel Newsletter V2 Step 1</strong> -> will represent the first step without a newsletter subscribe form.
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>WeltPixel Newsletter V2 Form</strong> -> will represent the step that contains the newsletter subscribe form, also in a single step experience this will be the block that you would like to customize.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this example, we've used design Version 2. If you're using a different design Version, make sure you search for the block that corresponds to it.

</p>
<p>
